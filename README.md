# Underground-Cable-Fault-Detection-System-Using-Arduino-Uno
This project is designed to detect faults in underground cables and pinpoint the approximate location of the fault. It uses an Arduino Uno as the main controller and measures resistance variations to identify breaks or short circuits in the cable. This system helps in quick maintenance and reduces downtime in power transmission networks.
# Features
Fault Detection: Identifies breaks or short circuits in underground cables.
Distance Measurement: Estimates the distance of the fault from the base station.
Visual Indication: Displays fault location on an LCD screen.
Efficient Monitoring: Helps in quick troubleshooting and maintenance.
# Components Used
Microcontroller: Arduino Uno
Resistor Network: Simulates cable resistance and detects changes.
Voltage Divider Circuit: Measures voltage variations to determine fault distance.
LCD Display: Shows fault location in kilometers.
Buzzer (Optional): Alerts when a fault is detected.
# How It Works
A voltage divider circuit is used to simulate an underground cable with resistances representing different sections.
When a fault occurs (break or short circuit), the resistance changes, and the Arduino calculates the fault distance.
The fault location is displayed on an LCD screen, allowing for quick identification.
This project is useful for power distribution companies, industrial plants, and smart grid systems, ensuring faster fault detection and reduced repair time.
